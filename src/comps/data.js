    info: "SEO results will not happen over night. It can take up to 6 months to see results. If you are interested in immediate results, you can alway purchase ad space with google, so that you rank on top of a page. However, people usually do not click on the ad links whenever they are searching for something, so we do not recommend this option. You may see a slight increase in web views, however, nothing beats a website with good SEO. Our SEO services are included with every website we build.",

      "Why is your services better than Wordpress, Wix, or any other DYI page builders?",
    info: "Our sites are better than the typical page builders that are used to build websites today, because the people who usually use this platform to build websites are not developers. That is the equivalent of us changing the brakes on your car for you, even though we are not mechanics. Sure, we can do it, but a job like that is better left to a professional. Also, page builders are bloated with lots of unnecessary code that slows you site down, and makes your site hard to read on mobile devices. Our sites are fast and look good on any device!",

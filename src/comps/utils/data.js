    title: "What is your turn around time?",
    info: "We think it’s great when clients give us a one week notice prior to a shoot; however, we often aren’t afforded that much time and are happy to help you more quickly if you need it. We can deliver edited still photos within 24 hours following the time of the shoot.",

  {
    title: "How will I get my files?",
    info: "For most projects, we will deliver edited digital photos to you via Google Drive within 24 hours following the completion of the shoot. If your project requires additional post-processing work including mapping, video editing, or image stitching, delivery time can take several days. You will receive an email that includes a link to your online photo gallery where you can download all of these files to a local device.",

      "Do I need to be onsite for the shoot?",
    info: "It is typically not necessary for you to be on-site for the shoot; however, you are welcome to join us if you feel it will be beneficial. Our pilots are trained professionals and can capture high-quality imagery in just about any setting. Please note that if you do opt to join us on the shoot, scheduling times might be delayed as this will have to be coordinated with multiple parties. We will share our project intake form with you prior to scheduling the project. This form allows you to describe your preferences, goals, and objectives in full detail. Most of our clients choose to communicate online or over the phone.",

    title: "What kind of weather would be best for the shoot?",
    info: "This depends on what you are trying to accomplish and your personal preferences. For marketing photos, many professionals prefer partly cloudy weather because of the abundant sunlight along with just enough clouds in the sky to display texture in the photos.",
    open: false,

  {
    title: "Can you capture the entire property in one photo?",
    info: "This largely depends on the nature of your project and the size of the property. Our pilots can legally fly at heights of up to 400 feet in most locations. A good rule of thumb is to assume the drone can capture about 20 acres in a single, nadir (camera pointing directly down), shot from 400 feet.If you are not looking for nadir shots, and would instead prefer oblique shots (captured at an angle), the imagery can include a much wider territory as the camera will be pointing out into the horizon.",
